## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser:
   - Local development: http://localhost:5173
   - Deployed version: https://sheikhsulaiman.github.io/oersted-experiment-teaching-aid/
2. Navigate between three tabs:
   - **Oersted's Experiment**: Toggle current on/off and observe compass deflection
   - **Magnetic Field Visualizer**: Adjust current intensity and explore field patterns
   - **Right-Hand Rule**: Learn the rule and test your understanding

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **React 18**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui**: High-quality React components
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **Lucide React**: Beautiful icon library
